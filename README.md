# Smart-Traffic-Management-System-using-IoT
It is a system designed to improve traffic flow, reduce travel time, enhance road safety, and provide real-time information to drivers about traffic conditions, road closures, and other important information.This reduces constant stopping and starting, which therefore helps to prevent the break down of traffic flow, thus reducing congestion. The system sets the same speed across the carriageway, which reduces the need for drivers to change lanes.
